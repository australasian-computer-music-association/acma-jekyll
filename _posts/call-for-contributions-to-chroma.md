_Chroma_, ACMA's Journal, is calling for contributions for our re-launch issue. We particularly welcome complete manuscripts from speakers at the Australasian Computer Music Conference in 2020 and 2021. Manuscripts received by 1/11/2021 will be considered for the first issue, however submissions will be reviewed and published earlier if possible.  
  
For more information see [the announcement on our journal page](https://journal.computermusic.org.au/chroma/announcement/view/1).
