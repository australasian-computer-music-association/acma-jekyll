On behalf of ACMA I would like to thank Andrew R. Brown, Matt Hitchcock and all the other helpers and volunteers who worked together to make the 2012 conference at the Queensland Conservatorium at Griffith University in Brisbane a huge success.

It was a well organised conference with great guests, a wonderful venue, excellent sound team, helpful people everywhere, perfect coffee and a really exciting atmosphere.

I would also like to thank our keynote speakers Miller Puckette and Michael Young for their inspiring talks.

Also thank you to everyone who participated in the conference, the speakers, performers and the audience. It is always great when the community gathers for special events.

Cheers, Tim Opie
