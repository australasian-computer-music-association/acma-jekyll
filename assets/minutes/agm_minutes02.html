We thank him for his work on this important but often thankless task.<BR><BR>The ACMA email list has had its share of lively debates and times of quiet over the year. It continues to be a vital communication tool for members (and others). Ian Whalley has managed this list and the web site for a number of years now. He will not continue in this role so we thank him for his effort.<BR><BR>Another ACMA executive member not standing for re-election is Anthony Hood who, as treasurer, has brought the ACMA books into line and seen the implementation of the GST tax rules. We thank him for keeping our financial house in order.<BR><BR>ACMA members contributed to a special edition of the journal Organised Sound edited by Ian Whalley. Ian and David Worrall are now Australasian editors for Organised Sound. <BR><BR>The New Zealand Sonic Art II CD has recently been released and a call <BR>for Vol. III will go out soon.<BR><BR>Paul Doornbusch represented ACMA at the ICMC on a panel examining the international accreditation of tertiary music Computer Music courses.<BR><BR>This lead to discussion about areas of study that are relevant for computer music courses. The follow list summarises work by Stephen Travis Pope.<BR>- Music theory and analysis<BR>- Musical representation<BR>- Computer assisted composition<BR>- Musical acoustics<BR>- Musical perception (psychoacoustics)<BR>- Machine recognition of musical signals and events<BR>- Sound recording and Music production <BR>- Sound synthesis and signal processing<BR>- Sound spatialisation<BR>- Gestural communication and control (including MIDI)<BR>- Computer music performance<BR>- Audio software design<BR>- Audio hardware design<BR>- Computers in music education<BR>- Computer music history, literature and musicology<BR><BR>There has been discussion in a number of areas about the possibility of running an ICMC in Australia or New Zealand in the next four years. While this has been considered, and rejected on a number of previous occasions there is reason to believe that we might takes steps to look seriously at the possibility.<BR><BR>Overall, I get the feeling that the Australasian Computer Music community is feeling more positive about itself and its future this year than for some time, and that we are turning the corner to leave the disappointment of serious cut backs to Academic and artistic funding in the 1990s behind.<BR><BR>Andrew Brown<BR>July 2002<BR><BR><BR><U>Treasurers Report 2001/2002&#150; Anthony Hood<BR></U><BR><BR><BR><BR><U>Membership Officers Report 2001/2002&#150; Peter Mcilwain<BR></U>The decision taken at the last AGM to include membership in the ACMA conference fee has greatly improved the operations of ACMA membership. The 2002 conference sees the inclusion of over 70 memberships. This is a significant increase from last year where the membership was 25. <BR><BR><BR><U>Web Officers Report 2001/2002. <BR></U><BR>Throughout the year, the ACMA site was updated as new material was<BR>forwarded. Chroma has now been added up to the current No. 30.  <BR><BR>The site remains to be run free of traffic and hosting charges to ACMA off<BR>the Webserver at Waikato University. Connect West continues to register the<BR>domain name gratis. It takes me about an hour a week to maintain. <BR><BR>There was one glitch in the year (early July) were the site could not be<BR>accessed due to a DNS configuration problem. I am waiting on a reply from<BR>Connect West to address this problem at the time of writing. <BR><BR>The site gets around 200 hits a day. The April stats are a good average,<BR>although the  hit rate usually increases dramatically closer to the annual<BR>conference.
