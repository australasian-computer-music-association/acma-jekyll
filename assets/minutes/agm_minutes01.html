The electronic mailing list acma-l had been transferred to Waikato together with the Web site, which were both being looked after by Ian Whalley.<BR></P><P><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4><B>Treasurer&#146;s report<BR></B></FONT><BR></P><P>Anthony Hood presented a provisional report.  It is provisional because there were some missing bank statements, and there was a discrepancy of approximately $140.  However all the major items were correct.  Anthony commented that the mail-out of <I>Chroma</I> was a major expense and that in future it would only be sent to financial members.<BR><BR><B>Motion: </B>That the treasurer&#146;s provisional report be accepted.<BR></P><P><B>Moved:</B> Andrew Brown.  <B>Seconded:</B> Paul Doornbusch.  <B>Carried.<BR><BR></B><BR><FONT SIZE=4><B>Membership Officer&#146;s report<BR></B></FONT><BR></P><P>Peter Mcilwain reported that while before the conference there were only 6 financial members, there are now 26.  He commented that there are currently no institutional members.<BR></P><P><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4><B>ACMA website report 2000/2002.<BR></B></FONT><BR>Throughout the year, the ACMA site was updated as new material was forwarded. Chroma has now been added up to the current No. 30. The site remains to be run free of traffic and hosting charges to ACMA off the Webserver at Waikato University. Connect West continues to register the domain name gratis. It takes me about an hour a week to maintain.<BR><BR>There was one glitch in the year (early July) were the site could not be accessed due to a DNS configuration problem. I am waiting on a reply from Connect West to address this problem at the time of writing. The site gets around 200 hits a day. The April stats are a good average, although the  hit rate usually increases dramatically closer to the annual conference.<BR><BR>A summary of stats for Sun-01-Apr-2001 00:11 to

This proposal will boost the membership, and since these people will automatically get <I>Chroma</I>, the community will be strengthened.<BR></P><P><BR></P><P>Paul Dornbusch raised the question of people who are given free registration at the conference because they are not otherwise able to attend.  It was suggested that they would be given free student/unemployed membership.<BR></P><P><BR></P><P>Lisa Meridan-Skipp said that a snail mail reminder about membership would need to be sent to members who do not attend the conference.<BR></P><P><BR>Peter Mcilwain said that a lot of people are reluctant to join ACMA at present.<BR><BR></P><P>Anthony Hood said that the benefits of membership are Chroma and a discount on conference registration; if the motion is passed this second benefit will disappear.<BR></P><P><BR></P><P>Lisa Meridan-Skipp suggested that people who registered for only one day of the conference would not get the membership included.

A Friday-to-Sunday conference would mean that they could attend for two days.  Chris Cree Brown said that the New Zealanders were currently in teaching time and would also prefer a Friday-to-Sunday conference.<BR></P><P><BR></P><P>Garth Paine said that people with installations needed a day to disassemble them, so for him the Thursday-to-Saturday timing allowed him to dismantle his installation on Sunday and still get back to work on Monday.<BR></P><P><BR></P><P>Andrew Brown said that he and Julian had discussed the issue.  The meeting did not issue a direction, but it was agreed that the points made in discussion should be brought to the attention of future conference organisers.<BR></P><P><BR><B>(4) Location of future conferences<BR><BR></B></P><P>A proposal having fallen through, there is no firm offer for the 2002 conference.  Several possibilities were discussed, but in the absence of the relevant people it was agreed that this should be pursued by the executive.<BR></P><P><BR></P><P>Similarly, for 2003 there were several suggestions but no firm offers.<BR><BR></P><P><B>(5) Members&#146; URLs on the Web site<BR><BR></B></P><P>It is a benefit of membership that member can have a link on the ACMA Web site.  Peter Mcilwain asked for clarification, and Andrew said that a member can nominate any URL he or she chooses.  It was pointed out that institutional members also get this benefit.<BR></P><P><BR></P><P><B>(6) Currency problems for New Zealand members<BR></B></P><P><BR></P><P>Lisa Meridan-Skipp said that there were horrendous bank fees for New Zealand members trying to pay the Australian dollar membership fee.<BR></P><P><BR>Anthony Hood listed two possibilities:<BR></P><P><OL><LI TYPE="1">The Association could obtain credit card facilities. This had been investigated, and proved too expensive (something like $500 per year).<BR></P><P><LI TYPE="1">The Association could set up a New Zealand bank account.<BR></OL><BR>Chris Cree Brown suggested a third:<BR></P><P><OL><LI TYPE="1">A New Zealand member could act as a central collection point, so that only one bank transfer fee would be incurred.<BR></OL></P><P><BR></P><P>After some discussion it was agreed that the third possibility should be tried, and that ACMA would pay the transfer fee.<BR></P><P><BR>After further discussion about exchange rates, the following motion was proposed.<BR><BR></P><P><B>Motion: </B>(1) That the membership fee for New Zealand residents be $NZ 30; with a student/unemployed rate of $NZ 15 and institutional membership of $NZ 100.<BR>(2) That residents of countries other than Australia and New Zealand pay in Australian dollars.<BR></P><P><B>Moved:</B> Paul Doornbusch.  <B>Seconded:</B> Lisa Meridan-Skipp.<BR><BR>The motion was <B>carried</B>.<BR><BR><BR></P><P><B>(7) Attendance of students<BR></B></P><P><BR></P><P>Andrew Brown commented that in general it has been difficult to get students to attend ACMA conferences, despite cheap registration.  This year a group of eight students came down from QUT.  Benn Woods said that the students had their attendance partly supported by a grant from the QUT student guild, and suggested that similar grants might be obtained from student guilds or unions at other places.<BR></P><P><BR><BR><BR>Andrew Brown closed the meeting at 7.45 pm.<BR></P></BODY></HTML>
