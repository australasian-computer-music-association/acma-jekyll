His research centers on designing musical networks for group collaboration with a special focus on devices and applications for novices and children. His publications appear in Computer Music Journal, Leonardo Music Journal, and Personal Technologies and in conference proceedings such as ICMC, CIM and CHI. He has been commissioned to compose and develop workshops and installations by orchestras, art exhibitions, and festivals worldwide. His work has been featured at Ars Electronica, the Smithsonian Museum, Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, the Cooper Hewitt Museum, the National Irish Symphony Orchestra and the Scottish BBC Symphony Orchestra, among others. Before coming to MIT Mr. Weinberg founded Sense Multimedia and served as the director of product design at MusicNotes, where he was responsible for the development of a number of influential music software packages. He received his MS in media arts and sciences from MIT and his B.A. majoring in music, arts, and computer science from Tel Aviv University, where he founded the electronic music studio in the musicology department and developed the electronic music curriculum.\n\nBernard Parmegiani: (FRANCE)\n\nParmegiani entered the Group of Musical Research in 1959 where he studied electroacoustic music under Pierre Schaeffer. Programmed in international festivals and concerts on throughout the world he has been awarded the Prix de l’Académie du Disque Français (1979); Prix de la SACEM (1981); Les Victoires de la Musique (1990); and the Prix «Magister» au Concours International de Bourges (1991). His work has expanded from the traditional world of Musique Concrete to include video art in works such as: The Eye listens (1973), Jeux of artifices (1979) and the transparent Screen (1973). He also been involved in the nexus  between improvisation techniques and electroacoustic music through work with various free jazz groups: J-L Chautemps, B Vitet, Michel Portal and Popular music groups such as  The Third Ear Band and Air.\n\nJoseph Waters: (USA)\n\nJoseph Waters studied composition at Yale University, the Universities of Oregon and Minnesota, and Stockholms Musikpedagogiska Institut. His primary teachers were Jacob Druckman, Bernard Rands, Roger Reynolds, Dominick Argento, Martin Bresnick, Robert Kyr and Jeffrey Stolet. He is a member of the first generation of American classical composers who grew up playing in rock bands. Throughout his career he has been intrigued by the connections, confluences, and tensions which entangle and bind the great musics of Europe and Africa. Much of his work involves interactions between electronic and acoustic instruments. He has been involved in Inter-disciplinary and collaborative works on and off since the early 1980’s. His works are regularly performed around the world. Principal performances include the Festival of Chinese Arts (Hong Kong), the International Computer Music Conference (ICMA), ISMEAM ‘98 (Hungary), the ALTERNATIVA Festival Moscow (Russia), MUSICA NOVA, in Londrina, Brazil and across the United States. Waters is the Artistic Director of the North West Electro-Acoustic Music Organization (NWEAMO) in Portland, Oregon. He also founded and co-directed Network for New Music in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the 1980s.He has received numerous awards in composition, including National Endowment for the Arts/Rockefeller Foundation (through the Painted Bride Arts Center, Philadelphia), Regional Arts and Culture Council and Pennsylvania Council on the Arts grants. He taught music composition, theory and electronic music at Lewis &amp; Clark College in Portland, Oregon from 1993—2001. From fall 2001 he is Assistant Professor and Director of Electro-Acoustic and Media Composition at San Diego State University.\n\nEnsemble-in-Residence: Blisters (AUS)\n\nBlisters is Australia’s first ensemble of interactive-electroacoustic instrument builders. The quintet boasts nearly 100 years worth of collective experience in this area and its members have been building instruments, composing and improvising since the 1970s.  Automatic violins, thinking-instruments, modified instruments, LightHarps, giant Laser lyres, real air and sensorlab guitars, microtonal instruments, installations, Leather serpents and retro-radio style objects are just some of music making machines you would expect to experience at any given Blisters event. Blisters is Jon Rose, Rainer Linz, Tom Fryer, Joanne Cannon and Stuart Favilla.  The ensemble aims to explore 21st Century music-making through instrument development, behaviour, interaction, group-improvisation, production and performance.\n\nHosted at\n\nstudio for research in performance technology \n0893706826 \nWAAPA@ECU \n2 Bradford St \nMount Lawley \n6050\n",

ACMC is the annual gathering of the Australasian Computer Music Association where you are invited to share and discuss emerging research and innovative practice in computer/electronic/digital music. ACMC is a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that will inspire, challenge, and showcase the emerging work of global leading researchers and artists in this rapidly growing community of practice.\n\nACMC will take place on the 9th-11th October at our Sydney Campus at the University of New England, Parramatta. ACMC will partner with the Parramatta City Council and the Parramatta Lanes Festival to present a concert series in conjunction with a program of presentations and workshops across the three-day event with leading academics and artists.\n\nWe invite students, academics, artists, and all enthusiasts of digital and electronic music to attend this inspiring event. UNE students can access the event for free.\n\n2023 Conference Theme: ElectroMUSE\n\nThis year’s ACMC theme is ElectroMUSE. The Muse of Ancient Greek mythology are nine goddesses who preside over the arts and science and were the source of inspirational fire for the artist. To muse on something is to absorb in thought and to deeply reflect. ACMC2023 will absorb participants in thinking deeply about music and its relationship to all things technological, digital, and electronic. We will take inspiration from the technological muse of our age and engage with an array of creative processes and musical outputs throughout the event.\n\nTechnology has long been an integral part of music making practice and now more than ever, is a source of inspiration and collaboration among musicians and artists working with sound.\n\nHumans and machines continue to evolve, becoming ever more deeply entwined, with greater power than ever before, to impact our social and cultural fabric and alter the world. Technology offers great opportunity and promise but also brings challenges and many unknowns which can generate fear and distrust. As we navigate our rapidly changing technological world, we will muse upon, explore, imagine, investigate, reflect, make, collaborate, and draw inspiration from the emerging technologies that are fast becoming the Muse of the modern age, inspiring our music and music making practices.\n\nProgram\n\nPHIVE Installations\n\nUNE Installations\n\nKeynote 1\n\nKeynote 2\n\nPaper 1A\n\nPaper 1B\n\nPaper 2A\n\nPaper 2B\n\nPaper 2C\n\nPaper 2D\n\nPaper 3A\n\nPaper 3B\n\nDemo\n\nSpatial 1\n\nLive Concert 1 UNE\n\nSpatial 2\n\nFixed Media 1 UNE\n\nCalligrapix - The Muse of Calligraphy and Visual Arts (AV Works 1)\n\nCybErato - The Muse of Love, Sensors and Sound Synthesis (Fixed Media 2)\n\n\n  Wednesday 11th October 10:30am-12pm\n  University of New England, 28 George St Parramatta.\n\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nLyrictron -  The Muse of Music Production, Poetry and Phonemes (AV Works 2)\n\n\n  Tuesday 10th Oct 2-3.30pm\n  Riverside Theatre\n\n\nVoceST II (Massimo Fragalà)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nAll the sounds that form this composition derive from the elaboration of vocal\nsample. Starting from this very small sample (0.1756 seconds) I tried to change the\noriginal characteristics in order to generate a range of sounds more o less\ndifferent compared to their original variety. This was possible using particular\ntechnique of sound processing such as time and spectrum stretching, morphing,\nharmonisation, freezing and sustaining a sound on an explicitly specified grain,\ntransposing copies of sound on top of one another.\n\nBio:\n\nMassimo Fragalà graduated in Electronic Music and in Classical Guitar. His music has been performed in many festivals and conferences worldwide including ICMC 2003, 3rd Prize ex aequo 4° Concorso Internazionale di Composizione Elettronica “P. Schaeffer” (Italy, 2003), ICMC 2005, Festival Zèppelin 05, EAR Sounds Electric 2005, LAC06, ICMC 2006, Festival Mùsica Viva 2008 (Sound Walk), NWEAMO 2008, Taukay 2008 (FrammentAzioni), Vox Novus 2008 (60x60 project), LAC 2011, Emufest 2011, 60x60 2012 (PianoForte Mix), Csound Conference 2013, LAC 2015, Csound Conference 2015, Csound 30, WOCMAT 2016, LAC 2017, LAC 2018, ICMC 2018, MusLab 2018, LAC 2019, ICMC 2019, MusLab 2020, NYCEMF 2022, etc.. .\n\nDesolation (Andre Montanaro)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nDesolation is an 8’38” acousmatic composition made with digital and environmental sound materials. The title is inspired by the desolation inherent in man who does not accept belonging to the social fabric that he lives because he does not recognize himself in his arcane fabrics. Digital synthesis is obtained through subtractive synthesis processes, it refers, given a sound source (oscillators or partials) rich in harmonics, it is filtered from a spectral point of view by “subtracting” from it frequency bands or single partials. This filtering operation develops during the temporal evolution of the signal, it is organized into three sound typologies: low-pitched, mid-pitched, high-pitched, and is rich in beats. The piece was conceived by referring to processing techniques through the various filterings that widen and tighten.\n\nBio:\n\nAndrea Montanaro, multi-instrumentalist composer, director and teacher from Abruzzo: he obtained diplomas in popular music, clarinet, piano, jazz piano, organ and organ composition, multimedia composition, film music composition, at the Conservatories of Pescara, Rome and Verona. He collaborates with international artists such as Franco D’andrea, Calogero Palermo, Xavier Girotto with whom he has made engravings, compositions and didactic texts published by the Academy. Some of his compositions have been premiered at the contemporary music festival in Desenzano del Garda. To deepen the basics of instrumental composition, he dedicates himself to the study of multiple instruments. Winner of four international piano competitions. He has published liturgical music for Tau publisher. He teaches Analysis and Composition Theory and Musical Technologies at the Liceo Musicale of Vasto.\n\nString Theory (for live electronics and paetzold contrabass recorder) (Mark Oliveiro)\n\nProgram Note:\n\n“String Theory” is an interactive concert work that intertwines the resonant tones of the paetzold contrabass recorder, live electronic music featuring sub bass frequencies, and immersive video projections inspired by Galileo Galilei’s celestial research. Designed using MaxMSP, this multidimensional experience takes the audience on a captivating journey through the harmonious realms of both music and astronomy.\n\nThe paetzold contrabass recorder, renowned for its deep, resonating timbre, serves as the centerpiece of ““String Theory””.

The action and reaction form a single interaction, they are simultaneous and neither force exists without the other. In this composition, the GameTrak’s retractable tethers interact with the performer’s push, pull, release and free movements. Each time the performer releases the tethers, they are retracted back to the rest state, creating predictable yet unique realignment path each time. The data measured from the physical movements are mapped to control various parameters, creating musical expressions that are both superimposed and nuanced. The performer, sound producing engine, and the concert venue can be virtually connected from three different physical locations, producing the composition via network.\n\nBio:\n\nChi Wang is a composer and performer of electroacoustic music. Her research and compositional interests include sound design, data-driven instruments creation, musical composition, and performance. Chi’s compositions have been performed internationally including presentations at the International Computer Music Conference, New Interfaces for Musical Expression, Musicacoustica-Beijing, the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States Conference, the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, Kyma International Sound Symposia, Electronic Music Midwest Festival, Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival, Electroacoustic Barn Dance, Portland Biennial of Contemporary Art, I.

With a practice that jumps freely between Creative Coding and Circuit Bending, ṈìkṈáK is also known as the evil genius behind the Sydney-based cult band Toydeath.\n\nBio:\n\nI am an interdisciplinary artist and musician with a focus on light, sound and interactivity. Over the past 25 years, my practice has revolved around writing, playing, and recording music for live theater and moving image. In addition to my work in music, I also delve into video production, coding, and embedded electronics.\n\nRecently, I have been deeply engaged in research and development, exploring the realm of individual wireless, MIDI-controlled instruments. These instruments utilise gyroscopes and accelerometers to translate human movement into sound and music. What sets them apart is their unique ability to also control DMX lighting, video, and virtual reality. \nThe Round Sounds are innovative touch-activated, MIDI motion controller that fits comfortably in the hands. By manipulating this device, performers can effortlessly create a wide range of intuitive compositions, sounds, and syncopated rhythms. Designed with physical performers in mind, the Round Sounds serve as the ideal bridge between musicians, dancers and jugglers.\nIn 1995, as one of the founding members of the band Toydeath, I embarked on a journey of crafting distinctive electronic instruments using circuit bending techniques. Toydeath, which remains active to this day, has graced stages across Australia, including notable performances at the Sydney Biennale, Big Day Out, and The Great Escape Festival. Additionally, we have embarked on international tours throughout Europe, the USA, and Asia.\nI’ve continued to develop this element of my practice, adapting and re-purposing existing domestic technologies and intuitive physical interfaces to create new audio-visual devices for performances and multimedia installations. For example the use of embedded electronics, sensors, and programming to create interactive devices for the Bio-luminescent jellyfish in ERTH’s Prehistoric Aquarium.\nOverall, my work seamlessly merges various artistic disciplines, pushing the boundaries of sound, technology, and performance to create immersive experiences for audiences.\n\nLowkey Austin presents Superette (Lachlan Austin)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nArtist: Lowkey Austin (Lachlan Austin)\nPerformers: Lachlan Austin \nSongs: 89 Cressida by Lachlan Austin \nTake the Ride by Lachlan Austin \nNewTech by Lachlan Austin \nShow me Luv by Lachlan Austin \nStadius by Lachlan Austin\n\nBio:\n\nLowkey Austin has in the past played his unique cruise faced glitch, electronica at shows in notable venues, such as Oxford Art Factory, and Knox Bar Underground supporting talented groups such as Spirals and Ears.

In the interaction of these programs, a new eco-system to support microtonal music has come together, and these, with the tools and abilities they imply have greatly expanded the possibilities for microtonal performance, especially in real-time. This paper looks at several of these programs, and how they interact to create a new, more powerful composing environment. The principal programs that allow this program to flourish are MTS-ESP by Oddmusic, Wilsonic by Marcus Hobbs, and VCV-Rack Pro by Andrew Belt and associates. As more developers have come on board supporting the MTS-ESP standard, the number of instruments that are now microtonally capable has expanded greatly. Also, “framework” programs, such as Ableton Live, Bitwig Studio, and Reaper, make the implementation of this ecosystem quite easy.\n\nUsing  the Pentadic Diamond page of the Wilsonic computer music program, with three instruments, Arturia DX7, Pianoteq, and Surge XT, playing a 3 voice random walk canon made with Algorithmic Arts MusicWonk.  The first minute uses the 21-note master set, then we get 10 sections of 30 seconds each going through the 10 five-note subsets, then a final minute of all 21 notes again.\n\nBio:\n\nWarren Burt is an independent composer based in Ararat in Western Victoria. He has performed his music all over the world in a career spanning more than 50 years. He is currently involved in beta testing a number of microtonal music programs.\n\nZen of Aggression - Composing the Transformational Hybrid (Berk Yagli)\n\n\n  Piece and Paper Session 3 100 George St, Parramatta, Level 4\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe talk/presentation will focus on musical hybridity and critical methods developed for the hybridization of electroacoustic and metal music (a part of the presenter’s Ph.D. research). These methods are formed to build a blueprint for hybrid composers (ultimately not only specific to metal and electroacoustic but for other genres as well that combines spectromorphological focused music with harmony and rhythm-based music since this type of hybridity requires a unique set of challenges and complexities). Hybridity in music is a well-established and vibrant contemporary scholarly topic. Even though the current literature provides many useful terms and strategies regarding different types of hybrids, the methods for building hybrids are rare. The talk will specifically focus on the piece ‘Zen of Aggression’ and discuss the fruitful and problematic methods when approaching to compose a transformational hybrid (a hybrid where both genres affect each other at the deepest level in which the resulting hybrid would not sound like each of the genre-hence transformed) between electroacoustic music and metal. Different excerpts from the piece will be played when discussing the techniques and methodologies. The talk shall also briefly discuss different types of hybridity (transformational hybrid, eclecticism, polystylism, and so on), genre and its notions (their problems, their significance, and their contemporary uses), and the notion of fluidity when approaching the hybridity in music to set the context. As technology increases at a rapid rate and postmodern conditions only grow stronger as lines get blurry, hybridity has been more than a prominent musical power to embrace this current condition and reflect through what is considered music and art in the 21st century (and challenge the notions of high art and low art).\n\nIn a world where saturation becomes the norm, little to no values left without being commoditized, and opinions start to get one dimensional, the people living in the society evolve to become numb and alienated from overstimulation. Zen of Aggression deals with these emerging conditions and topics to produce an electroacoustic/metal hybrid piece as aggressively as possible. The composer intends to present this new way of living without compromising on the details of chaos.\n\nBio:\n\nBerk Yagli (born 1999) is a Cypriot guitarist, composer, and producer. His mission with his music has been to talk about social, political, and philosophical matters interestingly to invite the listeners into reflecting on the topics. He has been active in the UK for the past six years due to his education in Music and Sound Technology (University of Portsmouth), Masters in Composition (University of Sheffield), and currently at the University of the Arts London working under Adam Stanovic for his Ph.D. topic hybridity between metal and electroacoustic music. During his master’s, his main focus has been electroacoustic music composition, and currently, he is studying and working on the potential hybridity of electroacoustic music with metal music. He also composed, produced, and released a cinematic/epic social commentary progressive metal album ‘Symphony of Humanity’ in 2021. His works have been presented in Europe, Asia, North and South America including Espacios Sonoros (Salta, Argentina), New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival (New York, US), International Computer Music Conference (Limerick, Ireland), Seoul International Computer Music Festival (Seoul, South Korea), Sound Junction (Sheffield, UK), Convergence-De Montfort (Leicester, UK), BFE/RMA Research Student’s Conference (Plymouth, UK), Research on Contemporary Composition Conference 2022 (Georgia, US), Sonic Matter Festival 2022 (Zurich, Switzerland), International Confederation of Electroacoustic Music (Krakow, Poland), WOCMAT Conference 2022 (Taipei, Taiwan), SEAMUS (New York City, US), MOXSonic Festival (Missouri, US), Earth Day Art Model Festival (Indianapolis, US), Vu Symposium (Utah, US), Unfolding Narratives (London, UK), NoiseFloor (Staffordshire, UK), Perspectivas Sonoras (Morelia, Mexico), Audiomanzia Festival (Padova, Italy) and more.

(Jordan Lacey &amp; Toby Gifford)\n\n\n  Piece and Paper Session 4 UNE INSTALLATIONS 28 George St GROUND FLOOR\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis piece &amp; paper applies a new materialist examination of New Age claims regarding Quartz singing bowls. These claims include a belief that the bowls’ resonant properties, when tuned to the Western Major scale, activate chakra points. We discuss some issues surfaced by this claim: 1/. it connects two distinct cultural practices: the Western tonal system and embodied chakra systems; 2/. it appropriates ancient Buddhist rituals; 3/. the actual history of the Quartz singing bowl is ignored. The true history of the quartz bowl is its role as a crucible, with which the Czochralski Method was applied to fabricate silicon microchips for the 1980s computer industry. The subsequent discovery of its resonant properties (by persons unknown) and adoption by the New Age industry saw its reinvention as a highly profitable ‘healing’ tool. While this paper does not doubt Quartz singing bowls affect the human body, it critiques New Age theoretical conflations in three ways: 1/. it describes the embodied practice of phonetic chanting though which the ancient Vedic system identifies the location of the chakras; 2/. it maps the notes of these chants and the notes of traditional singing bowls and compares those to the Major scale ascribed to Quartz singing bowls; and, 3/. through a conference-based performance (to be discussed in the paper) the authors will present the Quartz singing bowl as an installation entitled the Sonic Crucible. The purpose of the performance is to explore the materiality of the object in relation to its original status as a tool for silicon microchip production. The paper concludes by arguing the New Age is the natural spiritual expression of Capitalism, insofar as it blends spiritual need with the neoliberal elevation of the economic individual. It then uses the installation-performance to argue that when materiality is met body to body, affective experiences can occur without the need for economic, historical and cultural appropriation.\n\nBio:\n\n“Dr Jordan Lacey is a sonic thinker, creative practitioner and transdisciplinary researcher who specializes in sonic theory, soundscape design and the creation of public sound art installations. He is based in the School of Design at RMIT University, where he teaches into speculative design studios and postgraduate creative practice research programs.\n\nDuring his academic career he has established himself as an internationally respected innovator in the area of creative-practice approaches to sound studies and urban soundscape design. He has written two respected books with Bloomsbury on the topic, has produced multiple urban sound installations and has been invited to present internationally at artistic and scientific conferences and symposiums. A comprehensive list of his works can be found at jordan-lacey.com\n\nHis first book Sonic Rupture: a practice-led approach to urban soundscape design (2016) had a significant and enduring impact on thinking and practice in the field. It develops a creative-practice methodology that challenges and advances existing acoustic ecology approaches by applying affect theory to soundscape and design practice.\n\nHis second book Urban Roar: a psychophysical approach to the design of affective environments (2022) develops new philosophical approaches to artistic practice by integrating affect theory and sound studies with the ‘Jungian’ turn in Deleuze Studies. The book also advances ambience theory and practice, and proposes methods for integrating artistic practice with design programs.\n\nHe has been the recipient of two highly competitive research grants: the Vice Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (2016-18) at RMIT University during which he completed two high-profile industry-funded projects to advance new thinking and practice in sonic placemaking and the Australian Research Council DECRA Award (2019-2022) in which he developed the theory and practice of biophilic sound design, which tests the possibilities of combining natural sounds and plants with urban installations.\n\nHe curated the Translating Ambiance exhibition at Yarra Sculpture Gallery (2019), which is discussed in a special journal edition he edited for Unlikely - Journal of the Creative Arts (2020) which provided opportunities for local and international artistic researchers to participate in a unique research project. The exhibition invited 12 artists to create 9 works that tested the idea of translating experiences of natural environments into urban spaces. See: translating-ambiance.com. This work went on to inform the ongoing urban sound installation, Sonic Gathering Place, which combines sound art and landscape approaches to create a serene space in inner city Melbourne.\n\nHe is the Associate Editor and lead Book Review editor for the highly respected international, open access Journal of Sonic Studies where he undertakes reviewing, networking and editorial responsibilities.

The ethos of the piece is to demonstrate the capacity to create immersive, paradigm shifting artworks together, despite disparate locations. Performers share performance data over The Internet to co-create a singular piece of rhythmically syncopated music, complimented with a detailed visual feed available to remote viewers. The aesthetics are aqua, ether, unity and transcendence. Telemidi is a targeted approach to MIDI network design with an explicit aim to minimise the obstruction of latency within live TMP events across a Wide Area Network (WAN i.e. the Internet). Undertaking PhD research at WAAPA (ECU, Perth, Aust.), Matt Bray has developed a live performance environment that also harnesses the MIDI to generate hi resolution reactive visuals that can also feed into VR headsets in real-time. This research seeks to identify the process of cross-cultural cooperation within the emergent TMP paradigm.  Critically, the process of sharing time sensitive music performance information over The Internet exposes data to latencies that disrupt the millisecond timing of human-to-human musical intercourse, therefore attaining successful TMP environments has proven to be overwhelmingly elusive. Telemidi networks exchange only MIDI information to benefit from the relatively miniature data packet sizes and the multifaceted capacity of this digital protocol.\n\nBio\n\nMatt Bray has operated as a professional musician (drummer, singer, guitarist, MIDI performer) since 1996 playing over 3,300 gigs, composing over 170 musical pieces (listed with Australian Performing Rights Association) including a piece performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and song writing credits on an Australian top 40 album and top 20 single. Using MIDI technologies in live environments since 1998, Matt has developed a range of methods for incorporating sample and synth based performance/composition in live performance, leading towards his 2018 Masters research demonstrating how MIDI can be exchanged over the internet to facilitate musicians performing with each other in real-time from any location on the globe. Currently completing PhD at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), Matt is researching further measures to reduce the obstruction of network latency, to increase Telepresence between performers and to harness latency artefacts to deliver ambisonics. Matt is also investigating pathways to present Network Music Performances to audiences within virtual environments.\n",

The Muse of Ancient Greek mythology are nine goddesses who preside over the arts and science and were the source of inspirational fire for the artist. To muse on something is to absorb in thought and to deeply reflect. ACMC2023 will absorb participants in thinking deeply about music and its relationship to all things technological, digital, and electronic. We will take inspiration from the technological muse of our age and engage with an array of creative processes and musical outputs throughout the event.\n\nTechnology has long been an integral part of music making practice and now more than ever, is a source of inspiration and collaboration among musicians and artists working with sound.\n\nHumans and machines continue to evolve, becoming ever more deeply entwined, with greater power than ever before, to impact our social and cultural fabric and alter the world. Technology offers great opportunity and promise but also brings challenges and many unknowns which can generate fear and distrust. As we navigate our rapidly changing technological world, we will muse upon, explore, imagine, investigate, reflect, make, collaborate, and draw inspiration from the emerging technologies that are fast becoming the Muse of the modern age, inspiring our music and music making practices.\n\nProgram\n\nPHIVE Installations\n\nUNE Installations\n\nKeynote 1\n\nKeynote 2\n\nPaper 1A\n\nPaper 1B\n\nPaper 2A\n\nPaper 2B\n\nPaper 2C\n\nPaper 2D\n\nPaper 3A\n\nPaper 3B\n\nDemo\n\nSpatial 1\n\nLive Concert 1 UNE\n\nSpatial 2\n\nFixed Media 1 UNE\n\nCalligrapix - The Muse of Calligraphy and Visual Arts (AV Works 1)\n\nCybErato - The Muse of Love, Sensors and Sound Synthesis (Fixed Media 2)\n\n\n  Wednesday 11th October 10:30am-12pm\n  University of New England, 28 George St Parramatta.\n\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nTitle (Author)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nBio:\n\nLyrictron -  The Muse of Music Production, Poetry and Phonemes (AV Works 2)\n\n\n  Tuesday 10th Oct 2-3.30pm\n  Riverside Theatre\n\n\nVoceST II (Massimo Fragalà)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nAll the sounds that form this composition derive from the elaboration of vocal\nsample. Starting from this very small sample (0.1756 seconds) I tried to change the\noriginal characteristics in order to generate a range of sounds more o less\ndifferent compared to their original variety. This was possible using particular\ntechnique of sound processing such as time and spectrum stretching, morphing,\nharmonisation, freezing and sustaining a sound on an explicitly specified grain,\ntransposing copies of sound on top of one another.\n\nBio:\n\nMassimo Fragalà graduated in Electronic Music and in Classical Guitar. His music has been performed in many festivals and conferences worldwide including ICMC 2003, 3rd Prize ex aequo 4° Concorso Internazionale di Composizione Elettronica “P.

The title is inspired by the desolation inherent in man who does not accept belonging to the social fabric that he lives because he does not recognize himself in his arcane fabrics. Digital synthesis is obtained through subtractive synthesis processes, it refers, given a sound source (oscillators or partials) rich in harmonics, it is filtered from a spectral point of view by “subtracting” from it frequency bands or single partials. This filtering operation develops during the temporal evolution of the signal, it is organized into three sound typologies: low-pitched, mid-pitched, high-pitched, and is rich in beats. The piece was conceived by referring to processing techniques through the various filterings that widen and tighten.\n\nBio:\n\nAndrea Montanaro, multi-instrumentalist composer, director and teacher from Abruzzo: he obtained diplomas in popular music, clarinet, piano, jazz piano, organ and organ composition, multimedia composition, film music composition, at the Conservatories of Pescara, Rome and Verona. He collaborates with international artists such as Franco D’andrea, Calogero Palermo, Xavier Girotto with whom he has made engravings, compositions and didactic texts published by the Academy. Some of his compositions have been premiered at the contemporary music festival in Desenzano del Garda. To deepen the basics of instrumental composition, he dedicates himself to the study of multiple instruments. Winner of four international piano competitions. He has published liturgical music for Tau publisher. He teaches Analysis and Composition Theory and Musical Technologies at the Liceo Musicale of Vasto.\n\nString Theory (for live electronics and paetzold contrabass recorder) (Mark Oliveiro)\n\nProgram Note:\n\n“String Theory” is an interactive concert work that intertwines the resonant tones of the paetzold contrabass recorder, live electronic music featuring sub bass frequencies, and immersive video projections inspired by Galileo Galilei’s celestial research. Designed using MaxMSP, this multidimensional experience takes the audience on a captivating journey through the harmonious realms of both music and astronomy.\n\nThe paetzold contrabass recorder, renowned for its deep, resonating timbre, serves as the centerpiece of ““String Theory””. Its commanding presence and virtuosic expressions evoke a sense of wonder, embodying the cosmic vibrations that once fascinated Galileo. Through MaxMSP, the recorder’s melodies and textures blend seamlessly with live electronic manipulations, where sub bass frequencies merge with the organic sounds, blurring the boundaries between the earthly and the ethereal.\n\nBio:\n\n“Dr Mark Oliveiro is a graduate and distinguished alumnus of the Sydney Conservatorium, the College of Music, the University of North Texas and the School of Music of Indiana University.\n\nAs well as working as an academic lecturer at AIM, Mark is a composer with diverse extra-musical interests including history, mythology and ancient literature.\n\nAt present, he has an interest in exploring, by way of conceptual abstract and musical aesthetic, the notion of reconstructing lost or imagined performance traditions. Dance and movement, theatrics and technology, language and social media, are just some of the non-musical solutions most apt for his ever expanding, contemporary composer tool belt.\n\nWith a keen and equal interest in acoustic and electronic music as well as interactive media, Mark’s music has been represented at national and international conferences and festivals including the World Saxophone Congress, the International Horn Society, the International Computer Music Association, the Society of Electroacoustic Music, Electronic Music Midwest and Vivid Music.”\n\nWhispers of the Branch  (Cecilia Suhr)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nWhispers of Branches is an improvisational violin and bamboo flute on fixed and live electronics; it is performed as a real-time audio-visual interaction.  The improvisational sound of the violin and bamboo flute is being processed electronically while affecting the drawing lines of the branches. This piece imagines the whispers of branches after all the leaves have fallen off.  What is the sound of nature’s whispers as the bare-bone branches move and dance on a tree?  Can there be a message of fortitude and strength as branches withstand the cold months of winter?  The violin and bamboo flute improvisation reflect on the sound of winds and branches’ silent messages while drawing out the actual sound in a visual form in real-time.\n\nBio:\n\nCecilia Suhr is an intermedia artist and researcher, multi-instrumentalist (violin/cello/voice/piano/bamboo flute), multimedia composer, interaction designer, painter, author, and improviser. She has won multiple awards in the field of visual art, music, interactive media, and academic research, including the MacArthur Foundation, Digital Media and Learning Research Grant Award (2012), Pauline Oliveros Award from the IAWM (2022), Silver Medal Award from the International Cambridge Music Competition (2023), Bronze Medal Winner from the Global Music Awards (2022), Best of Competition Winner in Interactive Media and Emerging Technologies from the Broadcast Education Association (2023), Saint Michael Achievement Medal from International Juried Fine Arts Competition, (2013), etc. Her music has been performed and featured at the NYCEMF, ICMC, SEAMUS, EMM, SCI, International Multimedia Arts Festival, New Music Gathering, Splice Festival, New Music on the Bayou, Hot Air Music Festival, Moxonic Festival, Beast Feast, Harvard University, Yale University, ISSTA, Klint Gut, among many others.

Currently, she is an Associate Professor in the Department of Humanities and Creative Arts at Miami University Regionals.\n\nDiscontinuous Mediation III (Rodrigo Pascale)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nDiscontinuous Mediation III is the third composition of this series. Unlike the first and second compositions, in which pre-recorded guitar and clarinet sounds were used, here pre-recorded viola sounds are used as sonic material. However, this composition has many similarities with its predecessor in terms of the conceptual environment and planning. As in “Discontinuous Mediation I” and “Discontinuous Mediation II”, the sounds were organized in a segmented way, which was responsible for forming a structure based by my compositional procedure. This method was applied to explore the conceptual idea of a perceptually continuous world being interpreted by a discrete mediation.\n\nBio:\n\nRodrigo Pascale (b. 1996) is a Brazilian composer based in the USA. Pascale graduated in composition from UFRJ in 2018. Since 2019, Pascale has lived in the United States, where he is currently pursuing his DMA in composition at Peabody Institute. His works have been selected for the following festivals: XXIX Panorama da Música Brasileira Atual, 2020 MUSLAB Exhibition, Espacios Sonoros 2020 Festival, V International Congress of Music and Mathematics and the Tesselat Electronic/Electroacoustic Concert. Furthermore, Pascale was one of the winners of the International Composition Contest organized by Sound Silence Thought and winner of the Festival Expresiones Contemporáneas 2020.\n\nAction-Reaction (Chi Wang)\n\nProgram Note:\n\nIn classical mechanics, Newton’s third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The action and reaction form a single interaction, they are simultaneous and neither force exists without the other. In this composition, the GameTrak’s retractable tethers interact with the performer’s push, pull, release and free movements. Each time the performer releases the tethers, they are retracted back to the rest state, creating predictable yet unique realignment path each time. The data measured from the physical movements are mapped to control various parameters, creating musical expressions that are both superimposed and nuanced. The performer, sound producing engine, and the concert venue can be virtually connected from three different physical locations, producing the composition via network.\n\nBio:\n\nChi Wang is a composer and performer of electroacoustic music. Her research and compositional interests include sound design, data-driven instruments creation, musical composition, and performance. Chi’s compositions have been performed internationally including presentations at the International Computer Music Conference, New Interfaces for Musical Expression, Musicacoustica-Beijing, the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States Conference, the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, Kyma International Sound Symposia, Electronic Music Midwest Festival, Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival, Electroacoustic Barn Dance, Portland Biennial of Contemporary Art, I. Paderewski Conservatory of Music in Poland, International Confederation of Electro-Acoustic Music, and WOCMAT in Taiwan.

In acknowledging this issue, the author has engaged with the hard of hearing and d/Deaf music community and created various compositional strategies that can be used to aid spatial audio composition for audiences of more broad types of hearing.\n\nThe paper presented will outline previous work within the field, summarise interviews with the d/Deaf and hard of hearing community, discuss the new strategies developed and new works developed based on those strategies, and the responses from the d/Deaf and hard of hearing community to the newly developed works based on those strategies. The works ‘Spatial Vibrations’ and ‘Music for PlayStation’ will be exhibited alongside the paper as installations exhibiting some of the spatial strategies developed.\n“\n\nBio:\n\n“Jesse Austin-Stewart (he/him) is a sound artist based in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand. He is a composer, sound artist, producer, and academic and is currently a lecturer at Massey University in the School of Music and Creative Media Production Te Rewa o Puanga.\n\nAs a sound artist, Jesse creates works that explore ways to make the field of spatial audio more inclusive. This creative practice often explores the intersection of spatial audio and disability and hearing, while also acknowledging barriers of finance and education. He has written works for contemporary dance and film and composed and curated performance art works and sound installations, among other works which have been exhibited in Aotearoa New Zealand, Japan, Australia, Czech Republic, Greece, Sweden, and France.\n\nAs a producer and audio engineer, he has recorded work for short films, orchestra, solo artists and bands, small ensemble, opera, and various other configurations. Jesse’s songwriting and production work has received over 2,00,000 streams online and has been award nominated.\n\nAs a person with a disability, accessibility is core to Jesse’s work and his artistic curation.”\n\nA new ecosystem for microtonal computer music exploration and composition (Warren Burt)\n\n\n  Piece and Paper Session 2 100 George St, Parramatta, Level 4\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nOver the past year or so, a number of new programs have emerged which make the composing and exploring of microtonal music much more easy and efficient. In the interaction of these programs, a new eco-system to support microtonal music has come together, and these, with the tools and abilities they imply have greatly expanded the possibilities for microtonal performance, especially in real-time. This paper looks at several of these programs, and how they interact to create a new, more powerful composing environment. The principal programs that allow this program to flourish are MTS-ESP by Oddmusic, Wilsonic by Marcus Hobbs, and VCV-Rack Pro by Andrew Belt and associates. As more developers have come on board supporting the MTS-ESP standard, the number of instruments that are now microtonally capable has expanded greatly. Also, “framework” programs, such as Ableton Live, Bitwig Studio, and Reaper, make the implementation of this ecosystem quite easy.\n\nUsing  the Pentadic Diamond page of the Wilsonic computer music program, with three instruments, Arturia DX7, Pianoteq, and Surge XT, playing a 3 voice random walk canon made with Algorithmic Arts MusicWonk.  The first minute uses the 21-note master set, then we get 10 sections of 30 seconds each going through the 10 five-note subsets, then a final minute of all 21 notes again.\n\nBio:\n\nWarren Burt is an independent composer based in Ararat in Western Victoria. He has performed his music all over the world in a career spanning more than 50 years. He is currently involved in beta testing a number of microtonal music programs.\n\nZen of Aggression - Composing the Transformational Hybrid (Berk Yagli)\n\n\n  Piece and Paper Session 3 100 George St, Parramatta, Level 4\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe talk/presentation will focus on musical hybridity and critical methods developed for the hybridization of electroacoustic and metal music (a part of the presenter’s Ph.D. research). These methods are formed to build a blueprint for hybrid composers (ultimately not only specific to metal and electroacoustic but for other genres as well that combines spectromorphological focused music with harmony and rhythm-based music since this type of hybridity requires a unique set of challenges and complexities). Hybridity in music is a well-established and vibrant contemporary scholarly topic. Even though the current literature provides many useful terms and strategies regarding different types of hybrids, the methods for building hybrids are rare. The talk will specifically focus on the piece ‘Zen of Aggression’ and discuss the fruitful and problematic methods when approaching to compose a transformational hybrid (a hybrid where both genres affect each other at the deepest level in which the resulting hybrid would not sound like each of the genre-hence transformed) between electroacoustic music and metal. Different excerpts from the piece will be played when discussing the techniques and methodologies. The talk shall also briefly discuss different types of hybridity (transformational hybrid, eclecticism, polystylism, and so on), genre and its notions (their problems, their significance, and their contemporary uses), and the notion of fluidity when approaching the hybridity in music to set the context. As technology increases at a rapid rate and postmodern conditions only grow stronger as lines get blurry, hybridity has been more than a prominent musical power to embrace this current condition and reflect through what is considered music and art in the 21st century (and challenge the notions of high art and low art).\n\nIn a world where saturation becomes the norm, little to no values left without being commoditized, and opinions start to get one dimensional, the people living in the society evolve to become numb and alienated from overstimulation. Zen of Aggression deals with these emerging conditions and topics to produce an electroacoustic/metal hybrid piece as aggressively as possible. The composer intends to present this new way of living without compromising on the details of chaos.\n\nBio:\n\nBerk Yagli (born 1999) is a Cypriot guitarist, composer, and producer. His mission with his music has been to talk about social, political, and philosophical matters interestingly to invite the listeners into reflecting on the topics. He has been active in the UK for the past six years due to his education in Music and Sound Technology (University of Portsmouth), Masters in Composition (University of Sheffield), and currently at the University of the Arts London working under Adam Stanovic for his Ph.D. topic hybridity between metal and electroacoustic music. During his master’s, his main focus has been electroacoustic music composition, and currently, he is studying and working on the potential hybridity of electroacoustic music with metal music. He also composed, produced, and released a cinematic/epic social commentary progressive metal album ‘Symphony of Humanity’ in 2021. His works have been presented in Europe, Asia, North and South America including Espacios Sonoros (Salta, Argentina), New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival (New York, US), International Computer Music Conference (Limerick, Ireland), Seoul International Computer Music Festival (Seoul, South Korea), Sound Junction (Sheffield, UK), Convergence-De Montfort (Leicester, UK), BFE/RMA Research Student’s Conference (Plymouth, UK), Research on Contemporary Composition Conference 2022 (Georgia, US), Sonic Matter Festival 2022 (Zurich, Switzerland), International Confederation of Electroacoustic Music (Krakow, Poland), WOCMAT Conference 2022 (Taipei, Taiwan), SEAMUS (New York City, US), MOXSonic Festival (Missouri, US), Earth Day Art Model Festival (Indianapolis, US), Vu Symposium (Utah, US), Unfolding Narratives (London, UK), NoiseFloor (Staffordshire, UK), Perspectivas Sonoras (Morelia, Mexico), Audiomanzia Festival (Padova, Italy) and more. He is regularly invited to compose his music in studios throughout the world including VICC-Visby International Centre for Composers (Visby, Sweden), CMMAS- Centro Mexicano para la Música y las Artes Sonoras (Morelia, Mexico), and Studio Kura (Fukuoka, Japan). He also recently won the 2022 18th WOCMAT Phil Winsor International Youth Computer Music Competition Award.\n\nSonic Crucible: a new materialist exploration of the quartz singing bowl. (Jordan Lacey &amp; Toby Gifford)\n\n\n  Piece and Paper Session 4 UNE INSTALLATIONS 28 George St GROUND FLOOR\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis piece &amp; paper applies a new materialist examination of New Age claims regarding Quartz singing bowls. These claims include a belief that the bowls’ resonant properties, when tuned to the Western Major scale, activate chakra points. We discuss some issues surfaced by this claim: 1/. it connects two distinct cultural practices: the Western tonal system and embodied chakra systems; 2/. it appropriates ancient Buddhist rituals; 3/. the actual history of the Quartz singing bowl is ignored. The true history of the quartz bowl is its role as a crucible, with which the Czochralski Method was applied to fabricate silicon microchips for the 1980s computer industry. The subsequent discovery of its resonant properties (by persons unknown) and adoption by the New Age industry saw its reinvention as a highly profitable ‘healing’ tool. While this paper does not doubt Quartz singing bowls affect the human body, it critiques New Age theoretical conflations in three ways: 1/. it describes the embodied practice of phonetic chanting though which the ancient Vedic system identifies the location of the chakras; 2/. it maps the notes of these chants and the notes of traditional singing bowls and compares those to the Major scale ascribed to Quartz singing bowls; and, 3/. through a conference-based performance (to be discussed in the paper) the authors will present the Quartz singing bowl as an installation entitled the Sonic Crucible. The purpose of the performance is to explore the materiality of the object in relation to its original status as a tool for silicon microchip production. The paper concludes by arguing the New Age is the natural spiritual expression of Capitalism, insofar as it blends spiritual need with the neoliberal elevation of the economic individual. It then uses the installation-performance to argue that when materiality is met body to body, affective experiences can occur without the need for economic, historical and cultural appropriation.\n\nBio:\n\n“Dr Jordan Lacey is a sonic thinker, creative practitioner and transdisciplinary researcher who specializes in sonic theory, soundscape design and the creation of public sound art installations. He is based in the School of Design at RMIT University, where he teaches into speculative design studios and postgraduate creative practice research programs.\n\nDuring his academic career he has established himself as an internationally respected innovator in the area of creative-practice approaches to sound studies and urban soundscape design. He has written two respected books with Bloomsbury on the topic, has produced multiple urban sound installations and has been invited to present internationally at artistic and scientific conferences and symposiums. A comprehensive list of his works can be found at jordan-lacey.com\n\nHis first book Sonic Rupture: a practice-led approach to urban soundscape design (2016) had a significant and enduring impact on thinking and practice in the field. It develops a creative-practice methodology that challenges and advances existing acoustic ecology approaches by applying affect theory to soundscape and design practice.\n\nHis second book Urban Roar: a psychophysical approach to the design of affective environments (2022) develops new philosophical approaches to artistic practice by integrating affect theory and sound studies with the ‘Jungian’ turn in Deleuze Studies. The book also advances ambience theory and practice, and proposes methods for integrating artistic practice with design programs.\n\nHe has been the recipient of two highly competitive research grants: the Vice Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (2016-18) at RMIT University during which he completed two high-profile industry-funded projects to advance new thinking and practice in sonic placemaking and the Australian Research Council DECRA Award (2019-2022) in which he developed the theory and practice of biophilic sound design, which tests the possibilities of combining natural sounds and plants with urban installations.\n\nHe curated the Translating Ambiance exhibition at Yarra Sculpture Gallery (2019), which is discussed in a special journal edition he edited for Unlikely - Journal of the Creative Arts (2020) which provided opportunities for local and international artistic researchers to participate in a unique research project. The exhibition invited 12 artists to create 9 works that tested the idea of translating experiences of natural environments into urban spaces. See: translating-ambiance.com. This work went on to inform the ongoing urban sound installation, Sonic Gathering Place, which combines sound art and landscape approaches to create a serene space in inner city Melbourne.\n\nHe is the Associate Editor and lead Book Review editor for the highly respected international, open access Journal of Sonic Studies where he undertakes reviewing, networking and editorial responsibilities. He is also a regular reviewer for the academic book publishers Routledge, Rowman and Littlefield, Bloomsbury and a variety of academic journals including Loci Communes.\n\nJordan is also a practicing musician, songwriter, bass guitarist and singer. He is presently planning his third book for Bloomsbury, which will explore the importance of developing sensorial relationships with vital objects.\n\nToby Gifford is a sound technologist, with a diverse array of research interests under the banner of ‘sonic environments’. As a sound-artist and musician he works with multichannel, binaural and ambisonic sound for virtual and augmented reality, immersive installation, and live performance. His practice utilises generative algorithms alongside field recording, with application in bioacoustics, aural architecture and computational creativity.\n\nHe is on the boards of both the Australian Forum for Acoustic Ecology, and the Australian Ecoacoustics Society, and was general chair of the 2016 New Interfaces for Music Expression international conference. He holds a PhD in computer music &amp; AI from the Queensland University of Technology, a Masters in pure mathematics (hypercomplex analysis on manifolds) from Washington University in St. Louis, and a first class honours in mathematics &amp; physics (quantum field theory, astrophysics, and hypercomplex analysis) from the Australian National University.”\n\nTransient Performance: Jingyin He\n\n\n  28 George St, Ground Floor\n\n\nProgram Note\n\n“transient is a human-mecha performance featuring three human performers with mechatronic sound machines (MSMs). The MSMs and their sonic manifestations draw upon the concept of ensemble and instrumentality in their development. Musically, the piece focuses on the jeu of each mechatronic sound machine (via material and motion) — reflecting and exploring the sonic interaction(s) among themselves and with the environment.\n\nEach mechatronic sound machine focuses on a unique sound-producing mechanism. kinetic.bowls involves the creation of spatial trajectories with custom-made kinetic loudspeakers. spectra uses motion and deformation to explore audiovisual relationships. stratum utilizes a rotating acrylic disc and solenoid to render audible the latent sonority of a planar material object.”\n\nBio\n\n“Blake Johnston is a sound artist, technologist, academic, and composer from Aotearoa, New Zealand. His practice sits at the intersection of experience design and emerging forms of technology, synthesising these fields to explore the perception of the audience. His work adopts new forms of technology to create environments and experiences across multiple disciplines including live performance, kinetic sculpture, musical mechatronics, wearable technology, and installation art.\n\nBridget Johnson creates immersive sound installations and performances that heighten the audiences’ experience and perception of space. Her work focuses on exploring the way sound can move through space and developing new interfaces to allow composers and performers to further explore expressivity through real time spatialisation in their work. Her installations explore these themes in combination with site-specificity and abstraction of time. Her works have been shown in the United States, Europe, Singapore, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nJon He is an experimental sound and integrated media artist, and researcher. He draws upon ancient Chinese sound practice and emerging technologies to explore the frontiers of sonic expression and experience. Jon’s works bring ancient sound worlds to contemporary practice by re-visioning them as gestural controllers, interactive systems and mechatronic musical instruments for installations and live performances.”\n\nSHOALZ Performance: Matt Bray\n\n\n  UNE Concert Space 28 George St\n  Wednesday 11th Oct 4-4.30pm\n\n\nProgram Note\n\nSOUND IN COLOUR: is a 30 minute live Telematic Music Performance (TMP), between London (UK), and either Perth (Aust) or on location at the conference (if feasible). Two musicians located continents apart, co-create a `comprovised’ Electro Dub piece that also generates an immersive, reactive visual feed that can be viewed through a VR headset or an online stream. The ethos of the piece is to demonstrate the capacity to create immersive, paradigm shifting artworks together, despite disparate locations. Performers share performance data over The Internet to co-create a singular piece of rhythmically syncopated music, complimented with a detailed visual feed available to remote viewers. The aesthetics are aqua, ether, unity and transcendence. Telemidi is a targeted approach to MIDI network design with an explicit aim to minimise the obstruction of latency within live TMP events across a Wide Area Network (WAN i.e. the Internet). Undertaking PhD research at WAAPA (ECU, Perth, Aust.), Matt Bray has developed a live performance environment that also harnesses the MIDI to generate hi resolution reactive visuals that can also feed into VR headsets in real-time. This research seeks to identify the process of cross-cultural cooperation within the emergent TMP paradigm.  Critically, the process of sharing time sensitive music performance information over The Internet exposes data to latencies that disrupt the millisecond timing of human-to-human musical intercourse, therefore attaining successful TMP environments has proven to be overwhelmingly elusive. Telemidi networks exchange only MIDI information to benefit from the relatively miniature data packet sizes and the multifaceted capacity of this digital protocol.\n\nBio\n\nMatt Bray has operated as a professional musician (drummer, singer, guitarist, MIDI performer) since 1996 playing over 3,300 gigs, composing over 170 musical pieces (listed with Australian Performing Rights Association) including a piece performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and song writing credits on an Australian top 40 album and top 20 single. Using MIDI technologies in live environments since 1998, Matt has developed a range of methods for incorporating sample and synth based performance/composition in live performance, leading towards his 2018 Masters research demonstrating how MIDI can be exchanged over the internet to facilitate musicians performing with each other in real-time from any location on the globe. Currently completing PhD at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA), Matt is researching further measures to reduce the obstruction of network latency, to increase Telepresence between performers and to harness latency artefacts to deliver ambisonics. Matt is also investigating pathways to present Network Music Performances to audiences within virtual environments.\n",

(online participants on Zoom).\n\nPresent\n\n\n  Mark Oliveiro\n  Charles Martin\n  Bridget Johnson\n  Jesse Austin-Stewart\n  Mike Callendar\n  Yichen Wang\n  Nicole Carroll\n  Donna Hewitt\n  Roger Alsop\n  Warren Burt\n  Vincent Giles\n  Andrew Brown\n  Jim Murphy\n  Sophie Rose\n  Neil Steward\n\n\nApologies\n\nVicki Hallett, Eve Klein, Patrick Hartono\n\nMinutes\n\nOpening\n\n\n  Acknowledgement of Country\n  President moved to accept the minutes of the 2022 AGM. Passed.\n\n\nReceive Committee Reports\n\nPresident’s report:\n\nCommunity building and networking was key plan for the executive during the\n2022-2023 academic year, I had the fortune to meet and discuss collaborations\nwith a number of research and industry partners to assist in future goals, and\nto assist in the annual conference. I am pleased to report there are future\nplans for collaboration with similar international associations (like SEAMUS\nand CEC), and we may also have interest with sponsorship with industry partners\n(like ADAM audio). Securing these networks and plans will be the job of the\nExecutive to build upon in 2024.\n\nInclusivity remains a strident goal for this association, and continuing to\nwork on achieving this aim, should persist into 2024. The 2022, and 2023\nconference are/were excellent examples of an inclusive community of practice.\n\nThe 2022 ACMC was a roaring success, it was a performance and artistic research\nheavy conference, with a good number of Australasian and International\ndelegates, and presentations. Of particular note where the outstanding display\nof facilities, installations and music technology; a testament to Massey\nUniversity, and the 2022 hosts: Bridget and Team. I would like to make a\nparticular note of the engagement from, and presentation of, the research of\nyounger academics (and early career/interest non-academics), inclusivity was\nwell demonstrated here. Furthermore, the New Zealand cohort of our association\nput the Australian members to shame in their representation of Indigenous\nPeoples and Nationhoods; ACMA has much to work in this area.\n\nThe 2023 ACMC conference is proceeding currently, and there has been an uptick\nin the presentation of formal research, yet the presentation of creative work\nand performance remains strong. Installations and the Riverside theatre\nofferings are the current highlight, yet another day of conference remains,\nmuch to look forward to. Showcasing Western Sydney has been a highlight, and\nDonna and team should be proud of their work, with commendations from the\nExecutive committee.\n\nReflecting on the recent conferences, I would like to note in this report the\ncurrent phenomenon of “representative non-attendance.” Too many conference\ndelegates are contributing work to the community, without the associated work\ntowards building networks within this association. I would like to encourage\nthis committee, and Executive, to work towards solutions to this issue.\n\nOn behalf of the ACMC executive, I would like to thank this committee for their\nhardwork, proactivity, and representation; we are effective because we as\nindividuals we are committed to our research and work, and this community.\n\nVice President report:\n\n\n  Bridget Johnson noted that we had a great time last year in Wellington and glad to be here this year.\n  Noted that we had 106 registrations at ACMC 2023 (well done!)\n\n\nTreasurer’s report:\n\nPrepared by Vincent Giles\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe bank account currently sits at $4115.01\n\nI do not currently have access to PayPal (but I believe Charles does).\n\nThere have been zero outgoing or incoming funds in the past twelve months, which suggests that: membership/attendance funds from the past ACMCs and website/paypal have not been withdrawn. There is therefore currently zero profit/loss.\n\nSuggested action: on advice from present company, Treasurer will gain access to PayPal to oversee these. Information needed: email address and 2FA associated with PayPal account, password.\n\nOutstanding:\n\nThere are possibly some moneys owing to some members for costs incurred that have not been withdrawn, unless they have been claimed through PayPal. This includes domain name registration.\n\nAuthorisation of Expenditure: ACMC2023\n\nThe executive committee authorised in an out-of-session meeting the expenditure of $1000 (4x $250) prizes for papers and performances at ACMC2023.\n\nAfter voting closes and winners are decided by the executive committee, winners will be required to send an invoice to ACMA for the fee of $250 (ex GST) and remittance will be sent upon payment to the winner. In the event that there is no winner of the prize in a given category, the prize will not be paid out and will remain with ACMA.\n\nMotions for Action:\n\nI would like to move for the following processes to be implemented from all ACMA events moving forward, and table the following for discussion at the AGM.\n\n\n  As a standard post-event follow-up, event organiser(s) will supply the treasurer and executive with a table of in-kind running costs for the event.

        "content": "Annual General Meeting of the Australasian Computer Music Association 2023\n\nDate: 11/10/2023\n\nLocation: University of New England, Sydney Campus, Parramatta, NSW. (online participants on Zoom).\n\nPresent\n\n\n  Mark Oliveiro\n  Charles Martin\n  Bridget Johnson\n  Jesse Austin-Stewart\n  Mike Callendar\n  Yichen Wang\n  Nicole Carroll\n  Donna Hewitt\n  Roger Alsop\n  Warren Burt\n  Vincent Giles\n  Andrew Brown\n  Jim Murphy\n  Sophie Rose\n  Neil Steward\n\n\nApologies\n\nVicki Hallett, Eve Klein, Patrick Hartono\n\nMinutes\n\nOpening\n\n\n  Acknowledgement of Country\n  President moved to accept the minutes of the 2022 AGM. Passed.\n\n\nReceive Committee Reports\n\nPresident’s report:\n\nCommunity building and networking was key plan for the executive during the\n2022-2023 academic year, I had the fortune to meet and discuss collaborations\nwith a number of research and industry partners to assist in future goals, and\nto assist in the annual conference. I am pleased to report there are future\nplans for collaboration with similar international associations (like SEAMUS\nand CEC), and we may also have interest with sponsorship with industry partners\n(like ADAM audio). Securing these networks and plans will be the job of the\nExecutive to build upon in 2024.\n\nInclusivity remains a strident goal for this association, and continuing to\nwork on achieving this aim, should persist into 2024. The 2022, and 2023\nconference are/were excellent examples of an inclusive community of practice.\n\nThe 2022 ACMC was a roaring success, it was a performance and artistic research\nheavy conference, with a good number of Australasian and International\ndelegates, and presentations. Of particular note where the outstanding display\nof facilities, installations and music technology; a testament to Massey\nUniversity, and the 2022 hosts: Bridget and Team. I would like to make a\nparticular note of the engagement from, and presentation of, the research of\nyounger academics (and early career/interest non-academics), inclusivity was\nwell demonstrated here. Furthermore, the New Zealand cohort of our association\nput the Australian members to shame in their representation of Indigenous\nPeoples and Nationhoods; ACMA has much to work in this area.\n\nThe 2023 ACMC conference is proceeding currently, and there has been an uptick\nin the presentation of formal research, yet the presentation of creative work\nand performance remains strong. Installations and the Riverside theatre\nofferings are the current highlight, yet another day of conference remains,\nmuch to look forward to. Showcasing Western Sydney has been a highlight, and\nDonna and team should be proud of their work, with commendations from the\nExecutive committee.\n\nReflecting on the recent conferences, I would like to note in this report the\ncurrent phenomenon of “representative non-attendance.” Too many conference\ndelegates are contributing work to the community, without the associated work\ntowards building networks within this association. I would like to encourage\nthis committee, and Executive, to work towards solutions to this issue.\n\nOn behalf of the ACMC executive, I would like to thank this committee for their\nhardwork, proactivity, and representation; we are effective because we as\nindividuals we are committed to our research and work, and this community.\n\nVice President report:\n\n\n  Bridget Johnson noted that we had a great time last year in Wellington and glad to be here this year.\n  Noted that we had 106 registrations at ACMC 2023 (well done!)\n\n\nTreasurer’s report:\n\nPrepared by Vincent Giles\n\nGeneral:\n\nThe bank account currently sits at $4115.01\n\nI do not currently have access to PayPal (but I believe Charles does).\n\nThere have been zero outgoing or incoming funds in the past twelve months, which suggests that: membership/attendance funds from the past ACMCs and website/paypal have not been withdrawn. There is therefore currently zero profit/loss.\n\nSuggested action: on advice from present company, Treasurer will gain access to PayPal to oversee these. Information needed: email address and 2FA associated with PayPal account, password.\n\nOutstanding:\n\nThere are possibly some moneys owing to some members for costs incurred that have not been withdrawn, unless they have been claimed through PayPal. This includes domain name registration.\n\nAuthorisation of Expenditure: ACMC2023\n\nThe executive committee authorised in an out-of-session meeting the expenditure of $1000 (4x $250) prizes for papers and performances at ACMC2023.\n\nAfter voting closes and winners are decided by the executive committee, winners will be required to send an invoice to ACMA for the fee of $250 (ex GST) and remittance will be sent upon payment to the winner. In the event that there is no winner of the prize in a given category, the prize will not be paid out and will remain with ACMA.\n\nMotions for Action:\n\nI would like to move for the following processes to be implemented from all ACMA events moving forward, and table the following for discussion at the AGM.\n\n\n  As a standard post-event follow-up, event organiser(s) will supply the treasurer and executive with a table of in-kind running costs for the event. This will help get a clearer idea of the financial value and in-kind support that ACMA is able to leverage, and provide information for potential hosts of events. It will also provide a catalogue of evidence for any future funding applications undertaken by ACMA.\n  At the closing of registration for a given event, registration data (and income) is provided to the treasurer.\n\n\nSecretary’s and Publications report:\n\n\n  Charles Martin discussed Chroma, the website, and the mailing list.\n    \n      Chroma has successfully published 12 articles as of the meeting.\n      We decided to publish the fully-refereed ACMC submissions in the journal as a special issue.\n      We noted that most authors have been early career researchers and that the journal has materially assisted ACMA members secure academic jobs.\n      The publications role, however, is a lot of work in terms of securing reviews and communication with authors and Charles asked to relinquish this role.\n      The ACMA website has been redesigned in Jekyll as the previous wordpress website was vandalised by hackers.\n      The current host is working for Chroma (Open Journal Systems) but we may have to change as the journal website is quite slow.\n      Currently Charles is paying for the website and should seek reimbursement.\n      We are still searching for some past proceedings: 2003, 2011, 2012, 2016.\n      The mailing list has been discovered by spammers and spurious subscription requests are out of control.\n      We should review how this is handled and whether it is valuable.\n      There were comments suggesting looking at how the live coding list and community are organised which is a good point.\n    \n  \n\n\nSecretary moved to vote that all reports are delivered as true representations in accordance with the act: passed.\n\nElect Committee Members\n\n\n  President moved to keep the executive officers except for publications and elect other attendees as non-executive members of the committee (passed the list of elected officers is below).\n  The secretary (Charles Martin) nominated Donna Hewitt and Mike Callander as publications officers (passed)\n\n\nPlans for ACMC2024\n\n\n  Mike Callendar suggested running the conference in Melbourne and offered to consider how it might work at RMIT.\n\n\nMembership, Fees, and Data\n\n\n  Charles Martin suggested that the previous practice of establishing a membership list from the conference should not happen without participant’s consent to share their name and contact information.\n  Suggestion was to establish consistent wording and a form for 2023 and future conferences to gather attendee data and convert into members\n\n\nSubmissions and action on Chroma Journal\n\n\n  new publication chairs can take on conversion of ACMC submissions into full papers as they wish, good to have two people handling it.\n  Charles will still handle the website stability and discuss article production using the template.\n\n\nOther Business\n\n\n  None\n\n\n",

The organisation provides a forum for new compositions, information sharing, and research about music technology and computer music, principally throughout Australia and New Zealand. The Australasian Computer Music Association is a community of composers, performers, teachers and technologists who have an interest in, are making, or supporting music making with computers.\n\nACMA is a non-profit association. \nThe main activity of ACMA is an annual conference, \nusually held in a capital city of Australia or New Zealand. Proceedings of these conferences are available from this website. \nThe conference serves as a forum for the members’ activites, music and research. ACMA also publishes a peer-reviewed journal, Chroma (formerly a newsletter from 1989-2006). \nACMA online communities including social media and mailing lists are also available for anyone to participate in. \nIn addition, locally organised events such as concerts and seminars are sometimes held.\n\nACMA is a regional organisation, and as such the majority of ACMA’s membership live in Australia and New Zealand. Although ACMA has no formal ties with other associations, other related regional organisations include the Canadian Electroacoustic Community (CEC), the Sonic Arts Network in the UK, Society for Electroacoustic Music (SEAMUS) in the North America, and the International Computer Music Association (ICMA).\n\nAustralasian Computer Music Association Incorporated\n",

    "content": "N.B.: Now calling for hosts for ACMC 2025+!\n\nACMC is the annual gathering of the Australasian Computer Music Association, a place to show and discuss research and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It’s a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community.\n\nWe are always looking for potential hosts for future conferences. ACMC has traditionally taken place in Australia or New Zealand and can be held standalone or co-hosted with another event.\n\nThe 2020 and 2021 editions were fully online and all conferences since then have included remote and in-person presentations and performances. Future events can be either hybrid or online in the interest of inclusion and sustainability.\n\nIf you are interested in hosting ACMC at your institution or organisation then please reach out to members of the committee.\n\nHow to host ACMC\n\nACMC generally includes 50-100 performances and talks from contributors who are musicians, artists, scholars, students and researchers. We have a guide to hosting ACMC online (link).\n\nAlthough ACMC is often hosted by academic institutions, we want to highlight the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture including those who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.\n\nHosting ACMC involves:\n\n\n  securing a conference location, and venues for concerts and talks\n  coordinating a call for participation for concerts and talks/papers (see ACMC2020’s call)\n  arranging for peer-review of submissions (we generally use CMT)\n  coordinating an online presence and hybrid attendance (see Ben Swift’s post for details)\n  managing ticket fees where applicable and payment for visiting artists or bursaries.\n\n\nSupport is available from the ACMA Committee who can provide guidance and experience from previous editions of ACMC. \n\nWe are always looking for new approaches that make ACMC a more inclusive and welcoming place including streamlining the application process, providing early feedback to potential performers/speakers, committing to a diversity in performers and speakers, reducing ticket fees in general, and providing support for participants who work outside of traditional institutions.\n",
