The coffee was always hot at the end of every paper session, the tech team for the concerts and installations were amazing, and the functions were very well catered. The whole event ran with an organic and fluid motion that would have taken a lot of preparation.\n\nI would also like to thank our keynote speakers Simon Emmerson and Ian Whalley, who were both such kind and welcome participants throughout the conference, also our other special guests John Cousins, Gerardo Dirie, John Elmsly, and Jason Phillips.\n\nThanks also to the School of Music at the University of Auckland and Professor Jenny Dixon for allowing us to use those wonderful facilities, and for opening the conference for us. Also thank you to everyone who participated in and attended the conference. It takes a whole community to make a conference.\n\nCheers, Tim Opie\n",

    "content": "N.B.: Now calling for hosts for ACMC 2023+!\n\nACMC is the annual gathering of the Australasian Computer Music Association, a place to show and discuss research and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It’s a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community.\n\nWe are always looking for potential hosts for future conferences. ACMC has traditionally taken place in Australia or New Zealand and has been held standalone or co-hosted with another event.\n\nThe 2020 edition was the first fully online ACMC, and we suggest that future events could be hybrid online/in-person in the interest of inclusion and sustainability.\n\nIf you are interested in hosting ACMC at your institution or organisation then please reach out to conference@computermusic.org.au\n\nHow to host ACMC\n\nACMC is generally includes 50-100 performances and talks from contributors who are musicians, artists, scholars, students and researchers. We have a guide to hosting ACMC online (link).\n\nAlthough ACMC is often hosted by academic institutions, we want to highlight the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture including those who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.\n\nHosting ACMC involves:\n\n\n  securing a conference location, and venues for concerts and talks\n  coordinating a call for participation for concerts and talks/papers (see ACMC2020’s call)\n  arranging for peer-review of submissions (we generally use EasyChair)\n  coordinating an online presence and hybrid attendance (see Ben Swift’s post for details)\n  managing ticket fees where applicable and payment for visiting artists or bursaries.\n\n\nSupport is available from the ACMA Committee who can provide guidance and experience from previous editions of ACMC. \n\nWe are always looking for new approaches that make ACMC a more inclusive and welcoming place including streamlining the application process, providing early feedback to potential performers/speakers, committing to a diversity in performers and speakers, reducing ticket fees in general, and providing support for participants who work outside of traditional institutions.\n",
