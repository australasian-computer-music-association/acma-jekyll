## Website of the Australasian Computer Music Association

This is the homepage for the Australasian Computer Music Association.

It's a basic website created using Jekyll and (mostly) markdown.

The site contains:

- information about the association (e.g., committee, rules, code of conduct)
- information about past and future conferences (e.g., calls for papers, proceedings)
- links to other important things (e.g., the community mailing list, social pages, Chroma journal).

Editing is generally restricted to ACMA Committee Members.

The website should show up at: <https://computermusic.org.au>
