This code of conduct is applicable to all events run by the Australasian Computer Music Association, including ACMC. All attendees, sponsors, and volunteers at our conferences and events are required to agree with this code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout events. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.  

## Short Version

The Australasian Computer Music Association is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event _without a refund_ at the discretion of the organisers.

## Long Version  

The Australasian Computer Music Association is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event _without a refund_ at the discretion of the event organisers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Event staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded badges. If you are unable to contact event staff, you can also contact the [Australian Computer Music Association committee members](http://computermusic.org.au/committee/).

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference, workshop and concert venues and related social events.
