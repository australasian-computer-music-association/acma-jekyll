Cross-posting of calls and opportunities from other communities (e.g., ICMC, NIME, SMC) is encouraged; however, we may moderate cross posts that overwhelm the frequency of posts from within the ACMA community.

Participation in the any of the above communities is subject to the [ACMA Code of Conduct]({% link code-of-conduct.md %}).

Please report any issues with the mailing list to the [president or secretary]({% link community.md %}).
