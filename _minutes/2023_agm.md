## Minutes

### Opening

- Acknowledgement of Country
- President moved to accept the minutes of the 2022 AGM. Passed.

### Receive Committee Reports

- President's report: (Include written note from Mark Oliveiro).
- Vice President report: Bridget Johnson noted that we had a great time last year in Wellington and glad to be here this year.
- Noted that we had 106 registrations at ACMC 2023 (well done!)
- Treasurer's report: Vincent Giles said bank account has been sorted out but PayPal is still outstanding, Charles and Vince should coordinate on this. We are still reconstructing membership info and conference attendance. We should look into the consumer affairs requirements.
- Secretary's and Publications report: Charles Martin discussed Chroma, the website, and the mailing list. 
  - **Chroma** has successfully published 12 articles as of the meeting. 
  - We decided to publish the fully-refereed ACMC submissions in the journal as a special issue. 
  - We noted that most authors have been early career researchers and that the journal has materially assisted ACMA members secure academic jobs. 
  - The publications role, however, is a lot of work in terms of securing reviews and communication with authors and Charles asked to relinquish this role. 
  - The **ACMA website** has been redesigned in Jekyll as the previous wordpress website was vandalised by hackers. 
  - The current host is working for Chroma (Open Journal Systems) but we may have to change as the journal website is quite slow. 
  - Currently Charles is paying for the website and should seek reimbursement.
  - We are still searching for some past proceedings: 2003, 2011, 2012, 2016.
  - The **mailing list** has been discovered by spammers and spurious subscription requests are out of control. 
  - We should review how this is handled and whether it is valuable. 
  - There were comments suggesting looking at how the live coding list and community are organised which is a good point.
- **Secretary moved to vote that all reports are delivered as true representations in accordance with the act: passed.**

### Elect Committee Members

- President moved to keep the executive officers except for publications and elect other attendees as non-executive members of the committee (passed the list of elected officers is below).
- The secretary (Charles Martin) nominated Donna Hewitt and Mike Callander as publications officers (passed)

### Plans for ACMC2024

- Mike Callendar suggested running the conference in Melbourne and offered to consider how it might work at RMIT.

### Membership, Fees, and Data

- Charles Martin suggested that the previous practice of establishing a membership list from the conference should not happen without participant's consent to share their name and contact information. 
- Suggestion was to establish consistent wording and a form for 2023 and future conferences to gather attendee data and convert into members

### Submissions and action on Chroma Journal

- new publication chairs can take on conversion of ACMC submissions into full papers as they wish, good to have two people handling it.
- Charles will still handle the website stability and discuss article production using the template.

### Other Business

- None
