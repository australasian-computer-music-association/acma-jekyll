****Keynote:** Paul D. Miller (aka DJ SPOOKY That Subliminal Kid)**

Born in 1970 in Washington D.C., Paul D. Miller is an artist, writer, and musician working in New York. Miller is best known under the moniker of his "constructed persona" as "DJ Spooky That Subliminal Kid.”

Miller has recorded a huge volume of music and has collaborated with a wide variety of artists, writers, musicians and composers such as Robert Wilson, Iannis Xenakis, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Mariko Mori, Kool Keith/Doctor Octagon, Pierre Boulez, Saul Williams, Steve Reich, Yoko Ono, Metallica, Chuck D, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, Paul Auster, and Colson Whitehead among many others.

Miller's work as a media artist has appeared in the Whitney Biennial; The Venice Biennial for Architecture (2000); the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany; Kunsthalle, Vienna; The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and many other museums and galleries. His video installation "New York Is Now" was exhibited in the Africa Pavilion of the 52 Venice Biennial 2007, and the Miami/Art Basel fair of 2007.

Miller's award-winning book "Rhythm Science" was published by MIT Press 2004, and was followed by "Sound Unbound," an anthology of writings on electronic music and digital media, published in 2008. His newest book, “The Book of Ice”, was published in July 2011 by Mark Batty Publisher. His latest, large-scale multimedia performance piece is “Terra Nova: Sinfonia Antarctica”, commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music/Next Wave Festival and other highly respected presenters.
