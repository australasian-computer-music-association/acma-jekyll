We’re excited to announce that the Australasian Computer Music Conference will take place at the Australian National University, Canberra, from July 8-11, 2020.

Website and Proceedings: <https://australasian-computer-music-association.github.io/acmc2020/>

ACMC is the annual gathering of the Australasian Computer Music Association, a place to show and discuss research and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It’s a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community.

This year’s conference theme is inclusion. We want to highlight the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture but may not normally attend an academic conference, including artists and scholars who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.

As part of these efforts, we have an early call for contributions open from 17 December 2019 with the opportunity to provide feedback and engage in conversation with all interested participants. Further calls will be published in 2020.

Early contributions or questions can be directed to [conference@computermusic.org.au](mailto:conference@computermusic.org.au) or addressed through the form on the conference website.

Looking forward to your submissions!
