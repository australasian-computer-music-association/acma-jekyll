The Conference of the Australasian Computer Music Association will hold its annual conference in conjunction with [TENOR 2019](https://www.monash.edu/tenor2019) (Technologies for Music NOtation and Representation) **July 23-27 2019** at **[Monash University](https://www.monash.edu), Melbourne**. The Association invites composers/sound artists, performers, academics, engineers, and technologists to present research and creative works on all aspects of electronic music, but especially work relevant to the conference theme _“**Seeing the inaudible, hearing the invisible**__”._ The conference theme encourages – but is not limited to – papers addressing the following sub-themes:

- Acoustic Ecology
- Acoustics of Music
- Acoustics, Space, and Sound Distribution
- Aesthetics, Theory, History and Philosophy
- Algorithmic Composition
- Analysis of Electroacoustic Music
- AR & VR
- Archiving & Preservation of electroacoustic Music
- Artificial Intelligence and Music
- Computational Musicology
- Composition Systems and Techniques
- Digital Audio Signal Processing and Audio Effects
- Distributed, Telematic, and Mobile Music
- History of Electroacoustic Music
- Improvisation and Technology
- Languages for Computer Music
- Live Coding
- Mathematical Music Theory
- Music Education
- Music Information Retrieval
- New Interfaces for Musical Expression
- Notation and Scores
- Perception and Cognition
- Piece plus Paper Presentations
- Software and Hardware Systems
- Sonification
- Sound Synthesis
- Studio Reports

Papers and presentations may be in any of the categories outlined below, including creative works (ACMC only). **Abstracts** of up to 250 words are due by Midnight AEST **Friday 22 March 2019** and are submitted via the EasyChair (**[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmc2019](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmc2019)**).

Note that the inclusion of creative work is encouraged as a means of research reporting. Stereo playback, and data projection facilities will be made available to all presenters.

## **Creative Work (ACMC proposals only)**

Note that ACMC also invites the submission of creative works for inclusion in concerts or a multi-channel listening room. Both the concert venue and listening room will be equipped with 8 channel surround systems. This may include multi-channel electroacoustic live performances, interactive and/or fixed media, or installations. Creative works are submitted via the same online abstract submission process. Please be sure to provide a link to the creative work (or supporting material) within the body of the abstract.

## **Music**

Composers and performers are invited to submit works in any style of electroacoustic music including the following categories:

- Electroacoustic music for fixed media alone, with up to 16 channels.
- Works involving live electronics, including computer processing, laptop orchestras, or live coding, with up to 8 channels.
- Works combining musical instruments or voice with live or fixed media electronics, with up to 8 channels.
- Video and multimedia works with up to 8 channels.
- Open to all composers, regardless of nationality, age or career stage.

### Details

1. Individuals may submit up to two works. Individuals may also submit proposals in other tracks (e.g. installations, papers, etc). Works of any length may be submitted, but, to be as inclusive as possible, we are more likely to be able to include shorter works than longer ones. If submitting two works, at least one work should be under 6 minutes long.
2. Works in progress are acceptable if a substantial part of the work is complete. If accepted, the final version of the work (1) cannot exceed the duration indicated at the time of submission and (2) cannot be substantially different from the versions submitted.
3. Please upload high quality MP3 stereo mixes for your audio including multichannel works. For video works, we strongly prefer lower resolution video files.
4. A 5.1 Surround Sound system will be available at the conference.
5. Composers may submit works for any instrumentation. However, instruments/performers provided by ACMC/TENOR are limited to those listed below. Please visit our the Tenor2019 web page for the most up-to-date list of performer/instrument possibilities.
6. Performers (artists that are not the composer of the work) may also submit up to two works with the agreement that they will play them if selected.
7. A work is eligible if it has not been previously played at either the ACMC or TENOR conference.
8. Works must be submitted online through our Conference Management system (Easychair). **[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmc2019](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acmc2019)**
9. All submissions should be anonymous. Please make sure that no author markings are included.
10. The organizers will provide in each performance space a mixing console, sound reinforcement system, microphones, cables, and a computer and audio interface for fixed audiovisual media playback. Composers of interactive works will be responsible for providing their own computer, audio interface, and any specialized peripherals.
11. Performers (to be updated):  Other performers may be used as well: _[Decibel New Music Ensemble](http://decibelnewmusic.com)_, _[Speak Percussion](http://speakpercussion.com)_, _[ELISION](http://www.elision.org.au)_, _[Clocked Out](https://www.clockedout.org)_, _[Monash Electronic Music Ensemble (MEME)](http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/music/electronic-music-ensemble)_**. Although every effort will be made to accommodate all submissions conference organisers reserve the right to stage performance of selected works based on logistical considerations.**
