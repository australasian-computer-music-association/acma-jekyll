## About the Conference

ACMC is the annual gathering of the Australasian Computer Music Association, a place to show and discuss research and artistic progress in computer and electronic music. It’s a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community.

This year’s ACMC theme is _futurity_. As creative computational processes and technologies take an increasingly centre-stage in the popular discourse, we too, in music, sound, technology and performance, contemplate the futurity of recent developments in the field/market(s); topics spanning decades of ACMA activity are now in common parlance, how do we lead these futures?
ACMA is an inclusive conference. We want to connect the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture, including and especially artists and scholars who are gender diverse, young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and mainstream institutions.

ACMC 2024 will take place at the **both** Australian Institute of Music (AIM) Sydney **and** Melbourne campuses. AIM’s Symposium will be on the last day (24 October) forming a 3-day conference with specialised lectures, workshops performances and presentations highlighting the latest in tertiary and post-graduate research at the Australian Institute of Music!

- (ACMC2024) 22-23 October, 2024 + (AIM Symposium) 24 October, 2024
- Remote/online connections (internet streaming options) will be available for presenters/attendees. (N.B., full registration may be required)

[^1]: The camera-ready deadline is the final deadline by which authors must submit their completed, fully formatted paper, incorporating all revisions, that is ready for publication without any further edits or changes. Full papers that do not have a camera-ready submission by this date will be appear in the program as abstract-only papers.

[^2]: The registration deadline is the final deadline that accepted authors must register for the conference to be included in the program. Submissions where no author has an appropriate registration will be removed from the program after this date.

## Call for submissions

We are calling for submissions under two categories: **papers/artist talks**, or **music with program notes**.

We consider both categories to be equally valuable formats for artistic research contributions in computer music. Both will be subject to peer-review and the split is simply to allow the most appropriate materials to be uploaded and to assist in forming the program. Potential submissions may not fit exactly into these categories and can be submitted according to whether the presentation format would be more appropriate as a talk or performance.

- **papers/artist talks** can be submitted as abstract-only (up to 2500 characters) or full text (2000 to 5000 words).
- **music with program notes** require a link to a video or audio version of the piece of music to be included in the conference. This can either be a demo recording for live performance
- **all submissions** will receive 2 peer reviews and may receive a meta-review by a program committee member
- **reviewing** is single-blind (reviewers unknown to authors)
- **abstracts and program notes** will be published in the conference proceedings.
- **papers submitted and accepted** as full text that meet the length requirements and that are finalised by the camera-ready deadline will be published in [Chroma]({% link chroma.md %}).
